# Tools

- `telemetry_guard`: sanity-checks telemetry catalog JSON files for basic shape.
- `wire_lint`: compares local wire catalog against Clustor artifacts.
- `seed_workload_data`: hydrates fixture data into `data/` for dev/test setups.

Other ceptra tools (`bootstrapper`, `bundle_deployer`, etc.) are intentionally omitted until product requirements demand them.
